# Event Logging System (Spring Boot + MongoDB)

A Spring Boot backend application that manages employees and automatically records
audit logs for every create, update, and delete operation using MongoDB.

This project demonstrates a clean layered architecture and real-world audit logging,
commonly used in enterprise applications.

---

## 🚀 Features

- Create, update, delete employees
- Automatic audit logging for all CRUD operations
- MongoDB-based persistence
- RESTful APIs
- Clean layered architecture (Controller, Service, Repository)

---

## 🛠 Tech Stack

- Java 21
- Spring Boot
- Spring Data MongoDB
- MongoDB
- Maven
- Postman (for API testing)

## ⚙️ Configuration

### MongoDB (`application.yml`)

```yaml
spring:
  data:
    mongodb:
      uri: mongodb://localhost:27017/audit_demo
````

---

## ▶️ How to Run

1. Start MongoDB

   ```bash
   mongosh
   ```

2. Clone the repository

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/rajan-1700/Event-Logging.git
   ```

3. Navigate to the project directory

   ```bash
   cd Event-Logging
   ```

4. Run the application

   ```bash
   mvn spring-boot:run
   ```

5. Application will start at

   ```

## 📊 Audit Logging

Every CREATE, UPDATE, and DELETE action automatically creates an audit log entry
stored in the `audit_logs` MongoDB collection.

Each audit log contains:

* Username
* Action type (CREATE / UPDATE / DELETE)
* Entity name
* Entity ID
* Timestamp

---

## 🧠 Key Learnings

* MongoDB lazy database creation behavior
* Spring Data MongoDB `save()` for insert and update
* Layered architecture best practices
* Handling real-world configuration and debugging issues

---

## 🔮 Future Improvements

* Add `GET /audit-logs` API
* JWT-based authentication
* Role-based audit logging
* Spring AOP for automatic logging
* Pagination and filtering
* Global exception handling
